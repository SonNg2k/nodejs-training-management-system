# nodejs-training-management-system
A role-based 🔐 access control single-page React app 🌐 developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Reactjs, and Nodejs). This is a training management system that encompasses four roles : admin, training assistant, trainer, and trainee.

The login credentials for different users with different roles are listed below, they can be used
to test if the app works smoothly.

| Role               	| Admin                	| Password   	|
|--------------------	|----------------------	|------------	|
| Admin              	| superadmin@gmail.com 	| superadmin 	|
| Training assistant 	| assistant1@gmail.com 	| assistant1 	|
|                    	| assistant2@gmail.com 	| assistant2 	|
| Trainer            	| trainer1@gmail.com   	| trainer1   	|
|                    	| trainer2@gmail.com   	| trainer2   	|
| Trainee            	| trainee1@gmail.com   	| trainee1   	|
|                    	| trainee2@gmail.com   	| trainee2   	|

Here is how it works. There is only one default admin account in the system. The admin can create trainer and training assistant accounts. The training assistant can create trainer and trainee accounts.
