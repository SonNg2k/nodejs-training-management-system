**First and foremost, please be patient and wait for my web app to load since it will automatically go to sleep after 30 minutes of no ingress traffic (due to my chosen free pricing plan provisioned by the Heroku platform)**

The login credentials for different users with different roles are listed below, they can be used
to test if the app works smoothly.

| Role               	| Admin                	| Password   	|
|--------------------	|----------------------	|------------	|
| Admin              	| superadmin@gmail.com 	| superadmin 	|
| Training assistant 	| assistant1@gmail.com 	| assistant1 	|
|                    	| assistant2@gmail.com 	| assistant2 	|
| Trainer            	| trainer1@gmail.com   	| trainer1   	|
|                    	| trainer2@gmail.com   	| trainer2   	|
| Trainee            	| trainee1@gmail.com   	| trainee1   	|
|                    	| trainee2@gmail.com   	| trainee2   	|

Here is how it works. There is only one default admin account in the system. The admin is allowed to create trainer and training assistant accounts. The training assistant is permitted to create trainer and trainee accounts.

Here is my planning diagram for this web app:
